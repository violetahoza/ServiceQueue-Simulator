# Queue-Based Systems Analysis Application

## Description
The Queue-Based Systems Analysis Application is designed to simulate and analyze queue systems, such as those found in supermarkets or banks. This application allows users to visualize customers waiting for service and provides insights into the efficiency of the queue management system. By entering various parameters through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), users can analyze how many clients can be served within a specified simulation interval.

## Main Objective
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an application that effectively simulates customers waiting in queues and analyzes the performance of the queue management system.

## Sub-Objectives
- Analyze the problem and identify the requirements for an effective solution.
- Design and implement a robust queue management system.
- Calculate key metrics such as peak hours, average waiting time, and average service time.
- Develop a user-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction and data visualization.

## Features
- **Queue Simulation**: Simulate multiple queues processing clients simultaneously.
- **Performance Metrics**: Analyze and display metrics such as the number of clients served, average waiting time, and peak hours.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Intuitive GUI for easy input of parameters and visualization of results.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust parameters such as arrival rates, service rates, and the number of service counters.

## Technologies Used
- Java 11 or higher
- JavaFX (for building the graphical user interface)
- Maven (for dependency management)
- JUnit (for unit testing)
